# Mathematical techniques for big data

## General content and evaluation methodology:

— M1 —

C1 + C2 - Introduction to Big Data vs Machine Learning + Streaming Algorithms 
C3 + C4 - Dimension reduction with PCA + t-SNE 
C5 + C6 - Bayesian Networks and Hidden Markov Methods 

— M2 —

C7 - Fuzzy Logic 
C8 - W1 deadline and M1 Exam
C9 + C10 - Regular expressions + Parsing expression grammars 
C11 - SMT + DFTs 

## W1 and W2 (Group assignments - topics and selection method):

W1 consists of a group assignment, in the form of a scientific article, on the application of Bayesian networks to a real problem. W2 consists of a group assignment, in the form of a scientific article, on the application of a Fuzzy Inference System to a real problem. Each group assignment W1 and W2 will have a randomly generated set of 3 students (if possible). 

## M1 and M2 (Exam M1 and Exam M2):

M1 and M2 consist of two short exams (aprox. 1h30) that will assess the contents of modules M1 and M2, respectively and solely.

## IP (Individual Presentations):

Each student should choose one of their group assignments (W1 or W2) and prepare a short presentation (in the style of a Pitch), with no more than 3 slides and a duration not exceeding 6 minutes.

Total of 5 moments of Continuous Evaluation (CE):

CE Mark = 25% W1 + 20% M1 + 25% W2 + 20% M2 + 10% IP
